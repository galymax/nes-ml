# NES ML

Simple markup language as enty point to learning HTML

It was originally designed for a one-hour web dev workshop for people with no prior coding experience.

## Concept
Several workshops were conducted using NES.css before NES ML was created. I found that getting used to the XML(HTML) syntax takes longer for people than the time available during a one-hour workshop. That's why NES ML was created to simplify the syntax while still producing for an appealing result.

### Key features
- Tag names based on common terms
- No attributes
- Minimal nesting required

## Usage

## Tags
The following tags are available
### `box`
Container with a black outline
```html
<box>
    Content
</box>
```
### `intro`
Same as `box` but all text is centered
```html
<intro>
    Content
</intro>
```

## How it works
- Styling is based on [NES.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/)
- The language takes advantage of HTML5's freedom to use custom tag names
